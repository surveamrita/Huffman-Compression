# Huffman-Compression

To write code for Huffman Encoder and Decoder.

Step-1: To determine which among the following priority queue structures gives best performance: Binary Heap, 4-way Cache Optimized heap and Pairing Heap in order to implement Huffman codes.

Step-2: To write code for Huffman Encoder and Decoder. The encoder reads an input file that is to be compressed and generates two output files â€“ the compressed version of the input file and the code table. The decoder reads two input files - encoded message and code table. The decoder first constructs the decode tree using the code table. Then the decoded message can be generated from the encoded message using the decode tree.
